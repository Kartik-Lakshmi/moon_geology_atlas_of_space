Introduction: In continuing support of a NASA
Planetary Geology and Geophysics-funded project to
digitize existing 1:5M-scale lunar paper maps, we
have renovated the digital versions of all of the 1:5M
series geologic maps. Because of increasing
emphasis on lunar studies from recent orbital data
returns, the renovations used new topographic data
and image mosaics to adjust the original linework
and the map boundary to the current ULCN2005 and
the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Lunar Orbiter
Laser Altimeter (LOLA) control networks.
The far-side maps were digitized to the new
bases and are ready for distribution.
These maps are not reinterpretations
